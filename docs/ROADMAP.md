## Milestone: MVP

### ~~Issue 1: Project Initialization & Repository Setup~~
- **Description:**
  - Create a new GitHub repository named `CSVTree`.
  - Set up the initial project structure with standard directories (e.g., `/csvtree`, `/tests`, `/docs`).
  - Include a basic README and a CONTRIBUTING guide.
- **Tags:** `mvp`, `documentation`, `backend`

---

### Issue 2: Define Core Architecture & API Design
- **Description:**
  - Map out the core modules: CSV parser, JSON transformation engine, DSL interpreter for JSONPath-like expressions, and JSON generator.
  - Design the public API for users to define mapping rules using a JSONPath-like syntax.
  - Produce architecture diagrams and document the design decisions.
- **Tags:** `design`, `feature`, `research`, `mvp`

---

### Issue 3: Implement CSV Parser Module
- **Description:**
  - Develop a module that efficiently reads and parses CSV files.
  - Decide between Pythonâ€™s built-in `csv` module or leveraging libraries such as `pandas` based on performance and scalability needs.
  - Ensure the module outputs data in a format conducive to further transformation (e.g., lists/dictionaries).
- **Tags:** `feature`, `backend`, `mvp`

---

### Issue 4: Develop the JSONPath DSL Parser/Interpreter
- **Description:**
  - Create a component that interprets and validates JSONPath-like expressions provided by the user for data mapping.
  - Research potential extensions or modifications needed so that the DSL can describe object creation and nested structures (since traditional JSONPath is read-only).
  - Document the DSL grammar and usage examples.
- **Tags:** `feature`, `design`, `research`, `mvp`

---

### Issue 5: Build the Transformation Engine
- **Description:**
  - Develop the core transformation logic that takes parsed CSV data and applies the mapping rules defined via the JSONPath DSL.
  - Ensure that the engine can support grouping rows and forming nested objects/lists according to user-defined rules.
  - Prototype with a few sample CSV files and transformation rules to validate the approach.
- **Tags:** `feature`, `backend`, `mvp`

---

### Issue 6: JSON Generator Module
- **Description:**
  - Implement functionality to serialize the transformed Python objects into JSON strings.
  - Ensure support for standard JSON output as well as formatting options (pretty-printing, minification, etc.).
  - Handle edge cases, such as encoding errors or unusual data formats.
- **Tags:** `feature`, `backend`, `mvp`

---

## Milestone: Alpha Release

### Issue 7: Create Documentation & User Guides
- **Description:**
  - Develop comprehensive documentation, including how to install the package, an API reference, and tutorials with sample use cases.
  - Write a detailed guide explaining the custom JSONPath DSL syntax and examples of transformations.
  - Update the README with usage examples and roadmap overview.
- **Tags:** `documentation`, `feature`, `alpha`

---

### Issue 8: Implement Core Unit & Integration Tests
- **Description:**
  - Write unit tests to cover CSV parsing, DSL interpretation, transformation logic, and JSON generation.
  - Develop integration tests that simulate complete transformation pipelines with various sample CSV files.
  - Set up code coverage reports and ensure critical functions are thoroughly tested.
- **Tags:** `testing`, `enhancement`, `alpha`

---

### Issue 9: Build a Command-Line Interface (CLI) Tool
- **Description:**
  - Develop a simple CLI that accepts CSV input and a mapping file (or JSONPath expression file) to produce the transformed JSON output.
  - Ensure the CLI supports necessary options such as file paths, output formatting, and verbosity.
  - Integrate the CLI with the core library functions and add user help messages and usage instructions.
- **Tags:** `feature`, `enhancement`, `alpha`

---

## Milestone: Beta Release

### Issue 10: Code Optimization & Refactoring
- **Description:**
  - Review the codebase for performance bottlenecks, especially in the transformation engine.
  - Refactor the code for maintainability and scalability as needed.
  - Implement logging and error handling enhancements.
- **Tags:** `enhancement`, `refactoring`, `beta`

---

### Issue 11: Continuous Integration (CI) Setup
- **Description:**
  - Integrate GitHub Actions (or another CI tool) to automate testing, linting, and code coverage checks on every commit.
  - Ensure that the CI pipeline builds the package and runs unit/integration tests.
  - Add badge markers for build status and coverage in the README.
- **Tags:** `testing`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `beta`

---

## Milestone: Version 1.0 Release

### Issue 12: Package Distribution & Release Management
- **Description:**
  - Prepare the package for distribution by creating `setup.py` or configuring `pyproject.toml` as per modern packaging standards.
  - Write a detailed release guide and update the changelog.
  - Publish the package to PyPI and set up versioning protocols for future releases.
- **Tags:** `documentation`, `feature`, `version1.0`

---

### Issue 13: Plan Future Enhancements & Feature Extensions
- **Description:**
  - Outline additional features such as supporting advanced join operations, aggregations, and custom plugins for special transformation cases.
  - Create a roadmap for future improvements to further extend CSVTree's functionality based on user feedback.
  - Document suggestions for integrations with other data processing pipelines and systems.
- **Tags:** `enhancement`, `feature`, `research`, `version1.0`
